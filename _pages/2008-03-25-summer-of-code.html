<p>This is a design I made the <a title="carcode project" href="http://code.google.com/p/carcode/">Carcode</a> project initiated by Dr.Toby Donaldson.</p>
<p>Catch up on this proj. I thought it was one cool way of initiation into the programming world.</p>
<p><a title="snapshot1.png" href="http://ofpenguinsandpeanuts.files.wordpress.com/2008/03/snapshot1.png"><img src="http://ofpenguinsandpeanuts.files.wordpress.com/2008/03/snapshot1.png" alt="snapshot1.png" /></a></p>
<p>Okay so this was only a basic design.</p>
<p>The project is some what in its infancy. There are still some cool features to be integrated, to realize sembelance of this design.</p>
<p>Some features the project will soon implement :</p>
<p>1&gt; An interface to design your own cars.</p>

<p>It could be something like this. There can be provisions for uploading custom images of cars.</p>
<p>2&gt; Next of course would be sensors fixed around the  car. Pixel sensors are a mentioned future feature.</p>
<p>3&gt; There should also be some kind of code-editor window:</p>
<p>Check out some of my posts on the Pyneko project. I've integrated a code-editor widget in program. I'm uploading a pic. here. For more details see <a href="http://gnuvision.com/books/pybook/" target="_blank">http://gnuvision.com/books/pybook/</a></p>

<p>PS.  Please download the <a href="http://gnuvision.com/pyneko/">earlier Pyneko version</a> and all its dependencies before downloading t<a href="http://gnuvision.com/pyneko/neko-unni.py">he improved version</a>. Replace the neko.py in the earlier versions with the neko-unni.py file which you can get as the improved version before you run it.</p>
<p>I thought the prospect of coding cars would be much more exciting than running a cat around,  (though the latter looks much more cute). Both Carcode and Pyneko targets novice Python learners. Though  PyNeko assumes nothing (being designed for school kids), Carcode targets a student community of the eleventh or twelvth grade with matbe some sort of programming base. The prospect of designing challenges for Carcode has a distinct thrill.</p>
<p>4&gt; Of course more stuff will be added. Check out :<a href="http://code.google.com/p/carcode/wiki/CarcodeVision">http://code.google.com/p/carcode/wiki/CarcodeVision </a></p>
